# Urban Tech Vision Statement

*Urban Tech* is an **online store** that allows **regular people** to **find and purchase phones, computers, wearables, and software products on-demand from anywhere**. Like traditional ecommerce platforms, it will contain hundreds of **products listed with their price, specifications, and image**.

Urban Tech is primarily designed for use by regular consumers looking to buy tech products. It therefore adheres to certain standards found elsewhere in the ecommerce industry. Urban Tech permits consumers to **search explicitly for a product or search brand by using a search bar,** while also providing less targeted search by allowing users to **select products by category by viewing the categories**. For example, if a user was looking for a new smart phone, but did not know which model they wanted, they could go to the “Phone” category and browse available models. Otherwise, if a user already knows they want the “iPhone 14”, they can look it up directly using the search bar.

Consumers will also be able to *scroll* through the homepage of the app to browse items. When a user clicks a button to view different categories specifies a category of product, e.g. “Laptops”, They will be able to select items from that category. They will also be able to use a search bar to find items by product name, brand, etc. This should greatly contribute to the efficiency of Urban Tech by allowing consumers to easily view, compare and purchase desired items. Users will also be able to **compare two items by price, stock, etc in a side by side view** using an explicit compare feature.

Urban tech will also have other traditional ecommerce functions like a **Cart** where customers can add items they are looking to purshase, view the cart with option to *update quantity in cart* and **Checkout** system where consumers will have the opportunity to review their purchase. Urban tech will have an additional feature **recommending three items** that are frequently purchased with the item the consumer is viewing. This should help prevent customers from buying a smart phone without a charging cable, for instance.

Urban Tech is envisioned as a mobile application, but it will be extensible so that future releases can have a web-based interface.

The project will be considered successful if **consumers find the app easy to use and helpful, as determined by a consumer satisfaction survey**. Urban Tech as a platform will also be considered a success if it is **profitable (makes more money than it loses)** and has at least *one thousand weekly users* .survey. Urban Tech as a platform will also be considered a success if it is profitable (makes more money than it losses) and has at least one thousand weekly users.
