### Retrospective analysis:

One of the major issues we faced during iteration was consistently **missing internal deadlines** and **inability to deliver our own expectation we had set for certain features**. While we had set reasonable deadlines, we struggled to meet them due to various reasons such as technical difficulties and inadequate planning. This issue affected the overall progress of the project and put more pressure on us as we neared the final deliverable date.

Furthermore, we faced **stability issues** with the final deliverable due to problems with the **database**. This resulted in **crashes and other technical glitches that made the app less user-friendly**. Additionally, we found that the app was not as visually appealing as we had hoped. Our design layouts lacked the polish and aesthetic quality that we had intended.

Another significant challenge we faced during this iteration was **integrating certain elements like images**. The process of incorporating these features into the app was **more challenging than anticipated**, and it slowed down the development process.

Finally, we found that our **time estimates were not accurate enough. This caused delays and put additional pressure on the team, leading to missed deadlines and increased stress levels**.

To address these issues, we have come up with several ways in which we can improve for future iterations. Firstly, we **plan to calculate project velocity by looking at previous iterations*, which will help us set better **internal deadlines**. This will give us a clearer idea of how much work can be completed in a given timeframe and allow us to plan better (we can calculate how successful we have been at the end of iteration 3).

We also planned to implement more **test-driven development to increase stability**. This involves **creating automated tests** for the app to catch bugs and glitches before they affect the user experience. By doing this, we can ensure that the app is stable and reliable.

Another approach we will take is to take more care when **designing layouts to ensure visual appeal**. We will spend more time refining our designs to make sure they are aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

To address the challenges of integrating certain features like images, we planned to spend more time figuring out how to do it before jumping into development. This will help us **identify any potential roadblocks and streamline the process, reducing the time and effort required**.

Finally, we will use prior experience to inform better estimates. By looking at past projects and iterations, we can get a better idea of how much time and effort is required for each task. This will allow us to set more accurate estimates and avoid delays in the future.
